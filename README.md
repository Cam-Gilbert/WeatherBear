# [WeatherBear](https://weatherbear.org) - Learn the meteorology behind the forecast

## About

The idea for WeatherBear came from my desire to read the National Weather Service forecast discussion on my phone each morning. Uhile it's possible to access these discussions on weather.gov, the site is famously not mobile-friendly,
and I got tired of swiping all over the place just to read a paragraph. Originally, WeatherBear was simply an emall bot that sent the AFD each morning. Then I realized the potential for these discussions to serve as a learning tool if sumarized at varying levels. 
So, I implemented OpenAI's GPT-4,1-mind model via their API and added that functionality to the emall bot. Eventually, I realized that others might benefit from this tool too, and that signing up for an email list felt a bit outdated, so I created the website. 
Now, anyone can get custom forecasts for anywhere serviced by the National Weather Service at any time.

## Functionality
### Area Forecast Discussion Summaries
The main functionality of the site is generating a custom summarized forecast discussion based on the closed nws office's area forecast discussion. The suary is currently done using OpenAI's gpt-4.1-mini model. These sumaries can be written at three different levels
"Expert", "Intermediate", "Novice" to make these area forecast discussions more accessible to people without meteorology backgrounds. There is also an option, "No sumary", if the user does not want the sumary at all. In this case the raw afd is displayed. An example
"Expert" summary is shown below.

> Forecast Summary for Raleigh
> 
> A weakening subtropical ridge centered south of Bermuda currently dominates the synoptic pattern, maintaining hot and humid conditions over central North Carolina today with modest diurnal convection focused along a surface trough in the Piedmont and Sandhills.
> This convection is supported by moderate instability and minimal convective inhibition in a moist environment with precipitable water near 2 inches. However, the influence of this ridge will wane as a positively tilted mid- to upper-level trough advances eastward from
> the central Plains through the Ohio Valley, accompanied by embedded convectively enhanced shortwaves and mesoscale convective vortices (MCVs). These features will enhance mid-level forcing for ascent over the region by Tuesday afternoon and evening, leading to more
> numerous showers and thunderstorms, especially across the southern and western Piedmont. The convective environment will be characterized by moderately strong southwesterly mid-level flow around 20 kt, deep moisture, and instability conducive to wet microbursts and
> urban flooding.
>
> Tonight, convection will diminish after sunset with residual isolated showers possible in the northwest Piedmont until midnight, followed by a generally quiet night with patchy fog development possible in the southern Piedmont and Sandhills due to radiational cooling
> under clearing skies or low stratus development. Tuesday night into Wednesday, the trailing cold front associated with the advancing trough will gradually move through, sustaining scattered convection primarily across the Piedmont with localized heavy rainfall potential
> due to embedded MCVs and slow frontal progression. This will lead to cooler temperatures Wednesday, with widespread cloud cover and precipitation keeping highs below normal. By late week, drier air associated with building surface high pressure will stabilize conditions
> and reduce precipitation chances, although model uncertainty remains regarding a possible low developing along the front near Florida, which could modulate eastern local precipitation late in the period.

### Explaining Confusing Sections of the Summary
There is also functionality for users to select portions of the summarized text they found confusing and a window will appear with an in-depth explanation targeted for their weather knowledge level. 
For this to occur the user must toggle the option by clicking it on the page.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41bb81e1-a852-41f2-bdee-3c8181fc1a82)

Then the user may select a piece of text and a summary will be generated. The example in the image is at the expert level from the example summary.

> It is important to note that these explanations are generated by AI, and they may not be 100% accurate, it is always important to double check information.
### Email Bot
The email bot functionality was the first piece of this project I built, as I wanted to area forecast discussion emailed to me every morning. As I developed the summarizing component of the project, I decided to add that to the email bot as well and allow for people to
sign up for an email list. You can select up to 4 times a day to recieve an email with short-term forecast information and a summarized forecast discussion at any of the three weather knowledge levels listed previously "Expert", "Intermediate", and "Novice". An example 
email is shown below at the expert level, examples at the other levels can be found at [here](https://weatherbear.org/emailbot)

> Subject: 🌦️ Daily Weather Update, Cameron

> Hello Cameron, it is currently 91 degrees F with a dewpoint of 69 F, for a feels-like temperature of 96 F at Raleigh / Durham, Raleigh-Durham International Airport with partly cloudy skies.
> 
> Today's Forecast:
> Tonight: Mostly clear, with a low around 75. Southwest wind around 7 mph.
> 
> Juneteenth: A chance of showers and thunderstorms after 2pm. Sunny, with a high near 96. Heat index values as high as 103. Southwest wind 8 to 12 mph, with gusts as high as 23 mph. Chance of precipitation is 40%. New rainfall amounts between a tenth and quarter of an
> inch possible.
> 
> Summarized forecast discussion:
>
> A strong synoptic cold front currently advancing from the Mississippi Valley will traverse central North Carolina Thursday into Thursday night, serving as the principal forcing mechanism for a well-organized severe convective outbreak. Ahead of the front, SBCAPE values
> are forecast to reach 2000–3000 J/kg, especially over the Coastal Plain and Piedmont regions, coupled with effective bulk shear of 25–35 kt, providing sufficient bulk shear to support organized multicell clusters or even transient supercells. This environment favors
> damaging wind gusts and hail, with a non-zero tornado threat embedded within the convective line. The timing places storm initiation in the NW Piedmont by early afternoon, with eastward progression through the Triangle mid-afternoon and reaching the Coastal Plain by
> evening. Convection will diminish overnight as the front stalls offshore. Prefrontal temperatures will remain hot and humid, with heat indices exceeding 100°F in some areas.
> 
> Post-frontal conditions Friday will be comparatively cooler and less humid with subsiding diurnal convection limited mostly to the coastal fringe. However, high pressure building over the region this weekend will induce a pronounced warm-air advection pattern beneath a
> strengthening Bermuda High extending westward across the Mid-Atlantic. This synoptic ridge will promote a sustained heat wave, featuring daily maximum temperatures climbing into the mid- to upper 90s and heat indices rising to or above heat advisory criteria (105–109°F) 
> by Monday and Tuesday. Overnight lows will remain elevated near record warm minimums due to persistent moist advection and boundary layer decoupling. Minimal precipitation is expected through early next week as the ridge suppresses convective initiation, aside from
> potential weak afternoon thunderstorms Wednesday in the western Piedmont, contingent on model consistency.
