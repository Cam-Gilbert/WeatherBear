    <p class="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-600">
      Each day at your selected times, WeatherBear will send a personalized email forecast based on your location and weather expertise level. The forecast is generated using data sourced from the National Weather Service, and the summary is produced using OpenAI's API to condense the local NWS office's forecast discussion. These Area Forecast Discussions (AFDs) provide detailed insight into the meteorological reasoning NWS forecasters use when creating local forecasts. I find that they are a fantastic resource for those who want more context to their forecast, and they also serve as excellent learning tools to better understand the meteorology behind the predictions. Because AFDs are often filled with jargon that can be difficult to interpret without a meteorological background, OpenAI‚Äôs language models help summarize them at varying levels of expertise so that anyone can benefit from them.

      Hello Dan, it is currently 71 degrees F with a dewpoint of 68 F, for a feels-like temperature of 72 F at Cincinnati, Cincinnati Municipal Airport Lunken Field with mostly cloudy skies.

      Today's Forecast:
      Juneteenth: Rain showers likely before 5pm. Partly sunny, with a high near 82. West wind 12 to 15 mph. Chance of precipitation is 60%. New rainfall amounts less than a tenth of an inch possible.

      Tonight: A slight chance of rain showers between 7pm and 8pm. Mostly clear, with a low around 64. West wind 1 to 9 mph. Chance of precipitation is 20%. New rainfall amounts less than a tenth of an inch possible.

      Summarized forecast discussion:

      Today, a cold front is moving through our region, bringing a chance of showers and some thunderstorms, especially this morning and early afternoon. As the front passes, temperatures will fall a bit, with cooler air moving in from the northwest. You may notice breezier conditions with winds shifting and gusting later today.

      Tonight, drier and cooler air will settle in under clear skies, leading to comfortable overnight lows in the upper 50s to mid 60s. Tomorrow will be a pleasant day with sunshine and warmer temperatures climbing into the 80s as high pressure shifts east and south winds develop. Looking ahead, a warming trend is expected starting Sunday, with increasing heat and humidity leading to potentially uncomfortable conditions early next week, including heat levels that feel over 100 degrees. It‚Äôs a good idea to stay hydrated and take breaks from the heat during this period.

      Hello Curt, it is currently 81 degrees F with a dewpoint of 42 F, for a feels-like temperature of 80 F at Buckley Space Force Base with mostly clear skies.

      Today's Forecast:
      Tonight: Mostly clear, with a low around 59. South wind around 8 mph.

      Juneteenth: Sunny. High near 96, with temperatures falling to around 94 in the afternoon. South southeast wind 5 to 10 mph, with gusts as high as 16 mph.

      Watches/Warnings in your area:

      Heat Advisory issued June 18 at 1:51PM MDT until June 21 at 6:00PM MDT by NWS Denver CO

      Summarized forecast discussion:

      A hot and dry weather pattern is unfolding for the Denver-Boulder area through the weekend, driven by strong upper-level ridging and westerly winds bringing warm air from the Desert Southwest. Today will be mostly sunny with light winds and no precipitation. Thursday sees temperatures climbing into the mid to upper 90s, thanks to compressional warming as west-southwesterly winds strengthen over Colorado‚Äîstill dry with little chance of storms.

      By Friday and Saturday, a robust ridge of high pressure combined with strong downslope winds along the I-25 corridor will push highs near or above 100 degrees, prompting a Heat Advisory for the area. The combination of dry air and gusty winds will create critical fire weather conditions, but these winds and low humidity might also reduce heat-related health issues somewhat. A Pacific Northwest trough approaches late Saturday or Sunday, with forecast uncertainty: if it arrives quickly, cooler temperatures and scattered storms may develop on the plains; if it lingers, heat will persist longer. Looking ahead to early next week, the trough will bring cooler, more unsettled weather with daily afternoon and evening storms possible, some potentially severe.

      Hello Cameron, it is currently 91 degrees F with a dewpoint of 69 F, for a feels-like temperature of 96 F at Raleigh / Durham, Raleigh-Durham International Airport with partly cloudy skies.

      Today's Forecast:
      Tonight: Mostly clear, with a low around 75. Southwest wind around 7 mph.

      Juneteenth: A chance of showers and thunderstorms after 2pm. Sunny, with a high near 96. Heat index values as high as 103. Southwest wind 8 to 12 mph, with gusts as high as 23 mph. Chance of precipitation is 40%. New rainfall amounts between a tenth and quarter of an inch possible.

      Summarized forecast discussion:

      A strong synoptic cold front currently advancing from the Mississippi Valley will traverse central North Carolina Thursday into Thursday night, serving as the principal forcing mechanism for a well-organized severe convective outbreak. Ahead of the front, SBCAPE values are forecast to reach 2000‚Äì3000 J/kg, especially over the Coastal Plain and Piedmont regions, coupled with effective bulk shear of 25‚Äì35 kt, providing sufficient bulk shear to support organized multicell clusters or even transient supercells. This environment favors damaging wind gusts and hail, with a non-zero tornado threat embedded within the convective line. The timing places storm initiation in the NW Piedmont by early afternoon, with eastward progression through the Triangle mid-afternoon and reaching the Coastal Plain by evening. Convection will diminish overnight as the front stalls offshore. Prefrontal temperatures will remain hot and humid, with heat indices exceeding 100¬∞F in some areas.

      Post-frontal conditions Friday will be comparatively cooler and less humid with subsiding diurnal convection limited mostly to the coastal fringe. However, high pressure building over the region this weekend will induce a pronounced warm-air advection pattern beneath a strengthening Bermuda High extending westward across the Mid-Atlantic. This synoptic ridge will promote a sustained heat wave, featuring daily maximum temperatures climbing into the mid- to upper 90s and heat indices rising to or above heat advisory criteria (105‚Äì109¬∞F) by Monday and Tuesday. Overnight lows will remain elevated near record warm minimums due to persistent moist advection and boundary layer decoupling. Minimal precipitation is expected through early next week as the ridge suppresses convective initiation, aside from potential weak afternoon thunderstorms Wednesday in the western Piedmont, contingent on model consistency.
